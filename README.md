# C# Console Application - People Management

This is a C# console application that manages information about people.  
It demonstrates how to define a `Person` class, collect user input, store data in lists, and display formatted output.

## Description

The project includes:
- Creating a `Person` class with properties like `Name`, `Age`, `Gender`, etc.
- Reading person data from the user
- Storing data using `List<Person>`
- Displaying all people or filtering specific data (e.g., only adults)
- Using methods, loops, and basic object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts

## Technologies Used
- C#
- .NET Console Application
- Visual Studio / Visual Studio Code

## Sample Code

```csharp
class Person
{
    public string Name;
    public int Age;

    public void DisplayInfo()
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Name: {Name}, Age: {Age}");
    }
}
